This plugin allows you to connect to Amazon s3 services. You should note that you
WILL NEED the Zend library for this. It needs to be installed in lib/vendor/Zend

Place this function in the ProjectConfiguration.class.php file:


      static public function registerZend()
      {
        if (!self::$_ZendAutoloader)
        {
          set_include_path(implode(PATH_SEPARATOR, array(
            sfConfig::get('sf_lib_dir').'/vendor',
            get_include_path(),
          )));

          require_once 'Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php';
          self::$_ZendAutoloader = Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance();
        }
        return self::$_ZendAutoloader;
      }

In the same file add this variable to the top of the class:

      static protected $_ZendAutoloader = false;


If you have already added something similar in this file then you should be good
as long as the function 'registerZend()' is in there and it is static.

app.yml

      prod:
        amazon_s3:
          enabled: true
          bucket:  BUCKET NAME

      dev:
        amazon_s3:
          enabled: true
          bucket:  BUCKET NAME

      test:
        amazon_s3:
          enabled: true
          bucket:  BUCKET NAME

      all:
        amazon_s3:
          access_key: PLACE ACCESS KEY HERE
          secret_key: PLACE SECRET KEY HERE

by default, amazon s3 is configured to be off by default, if you wish to have it
turned on by default the set 'enabled: true' for all

Things I need to do is have the ability to run tests on all the classes. Currently
I have no idea if this code works. I will be using it in the future for some projects
so I will maintain and update it as much as I can
